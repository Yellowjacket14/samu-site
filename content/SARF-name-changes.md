## South African Reserve Force Name Changes

Three years ago the ANC , in keeping with their tradition of 
changing the names of failing things rather than fixing them, 
began a campaign of name changes for the South African Reserve 
Force. Some of the name changes include the Cape Town Rifles to 
the Chief Langalibalele Rifles, the South African Irish Regiment 
is now the Andrew Mlangeni Regiment, and Regiment West Province is 
now Regiment Jan Smuts. 

The stated goal of the name changes is to make the Reserve Force’s 
units reflect South Africa’s martial tradition as a whole, not 
just the martial tradition of its English speaking population but 
also the traditions of the black population. But the reality of 
this name change, like all name changes in this country, is that 
it was done to cover up a failing institution and further 
marginalize the nation’s English and Indian population. By 
changing the traditions and names of these units it further 
disincentives English and Indian men from participating in the 
military even in the part time capacity of the reserves. 

The Reserve Forces name change is also indicative of another ANC 
theme. That is when they can’t build something good on their own 
they must just rename something that is already good and 
inevitably destroy what was once good. 

Luckily there is one ray of hope, most of the units set to change 
their names have yet to do so officially and the deadline has 
already passed. Also the Cape Town Highlanders has successfully 
refused its name change to the Gonnema Regiment and according to 
an official announcement it will remain the Cape Town Highlanders. 
This successful resistance against the name change shows that we 
can combat all name changes by refusing to use these new names 
that don’t belong to what they are attached to.
